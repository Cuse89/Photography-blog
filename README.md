Webpage is designed so that the amount of work needed to upload any future country blogs is as limited as possible.
The only work that would be needed to do is:

HTML-
- Type new blog for country (following same structure as others)
- Create new parallax menu section and menu button simply following same structure

CSS-
- 1 line of code linking to background photo (following same structure as others)

Javascript-
- Create a new javascript photo array in preferred order of photos (the same as others, ensuring array and html data attribute are the same word)
- Add case into switch statement (following same structure as others)

The javascript will automatically loop through the array and append images to HTML.

Currently website is only designed for larger screens, but plans are to make compatible for small screens too.
